What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?

	You get a message from git and .git folder is added to the 
	directory.

	I don't know why I need it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The area holds the file to be sent.

	It helps us decide what changes we want to commit to the
	repository.

How can you use the staging are to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	I can use to verify or reset changes.
