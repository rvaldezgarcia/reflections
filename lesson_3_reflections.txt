When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   To make it available for other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To review other contributions on GitHub from different users.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork: It's a copy from different user's repository. You use it when you want to modify a project without affecting the original.
	Clones: A clone is a copy of the content of a repository including the branches that has been copied to the user's computer. You use it in your computer.
	Branches: It's a thread from repository that has its own history of commits. You separate changes from other branches.
